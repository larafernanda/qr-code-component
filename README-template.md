## My process
### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Image color picker

### What I learned
Well, I already had some basic knowledge with HTML5/CSS3 so everything kinda ran smoothly, but man, I made just a noob mistake who had me stuck in code for like 2 hours and all because I wrote .body (as a class) instead of body in my CSS sheet. I was almost giving up Web Development career. Lol.
Overall, I tried my best to use my own website measures, even tho I honestly just mess around with margin and padding until they look acceptable.

### Continued development
I want to learn more about how to make responsive layouts, not just that initial viewport tag. I didn't try to make my layout mobile friendly because I have really no clue. Tips appreciated.

### Useful resources
- https://imagecolorpicker.com/ - This website helped me get the background-color.
